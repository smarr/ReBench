ReBench is a tool to run and document benchmark experiments.
Currently, it is often used for benchmarking language implementations,
but it can be used to monitor the performance of all
kinds of other applications and programs, too.

The ReBench [configuration format][docs] is a text format based on [YAML](https://yaml.org/).
A configuration file defines how to build and execute a set of *experiments*,
i.e. benchmarks.
It describes which executable was used, which parameters were given
to the benchmarks, and the number of iterations to be used to obtain
statistically reliable results.

With this approach, the configuration contains all benchmark-specific
information to reproduce a benchmark run. However, it does not capture
the whole system.

The data of all benchmark runs is recorded in a data file for later analysis.
Important for long-running experiments, benchmarks can be aborted and
continued at a later time.

ReBench focuses on the execution aspect and does not provide advanced
analysis facilities itself. Instead, the recorded results should be processed
by dedicated tools such as scripts for statistical analysis in R, Python, etc,
or [ReBenchDB][1], for continuous performance tracking.

The documentation for ReBench is hosted at [https://rebench.readthedocs.io/][docs].

## Goals and Features

ReBench is designed to

 - enable reproduction of experiments;
 - document all benchmark parameters;
 - provide a flexible execution model,
   with support for interrupting and continuing benchmarking;
 - enable the definition of complex sets of comparisons and their flexible execution;
 - report results to continuous performance monitoring systems, e.g., [ReBenchDB][1];
 - provide basic support for building/compiling benchmarks/experiments on demand;
 - be extensible to parse output of custom benchmark harnesses.

## ReBench Denoise

[Denoise][denoise-docs] configures a Linux system for benchmarking.
It adapts parameters of the CPU frequency management and task scheduling
to reduce some of the variability that can cause widely different
benchmark results for the same experiment.

Denoise is inspired by [Krun](https://github.com/softdevteam/krun/#readme),
which has many more features to carefully minimize possible interference.
Krun is the tool of choice if the most reliable results are required.
ReBench only adapts a subset of the parameters, while staying self-contained
and minimizing external dependencies.

## Non-Goals

ReBench isn't

 - a framework for (micro)benchmarks.
   Instead, it relies on existing harnesses and can be extended to parse their
   output.
 - a performance analysis tool. It is meant to execute experiments and
   record the corresponding measurements.
 - a data analysis tool. It provides only a bare minimum of statistics,
   but has an easily parseable data format that can be processed, e.g., with R.

## Installation

<a id="install"></a>

ReBench is implemented in Python and can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install rebench
```

To reduce noise generated by the system, `rebench-denoise` depends on:

 - `sudo` rights. `rebench` will attempt to determine suitable configuration
   parameters and suggest them. This includes allowing the execution of `rebench-denoise`
   via `sudo` without password and with the permission to set environment variables (`SETENV`).
 - [`cpuset`](https://github.com/lpechacek/cpuset/) to reserve cores for benchmarking.
   On Ubuntu: `apt install cpuset`

`rebench-denoise` is currently tested on Ubuntu and Rocky Linux. It is designed to degrade
gracefully and report the expected implications when it cannot adapt system
settings. See the [docs][denoise-docs] for details.

## Usage

A minimal configuration file looks like this:

```yaml
# this run definition will be chosen if no parameters are given to rebench
default_experiment: all
default_data_file: 'example.data'

# a set of suites with different benchmarks and possibly different settings
benchmark_suites:
    ExampleSuite:
        gauge_adapter: RebenchLog
        command: Harness %(benchmark)s %(input)s %(variable)s
        input_sizes: [2, 10]
        variable_values:
            - val1
        benchmarks:
            - Bench1
            - Bench2

# a set of executables for the benchmark execution
executors:
    MyBin1:
        path: bin
        executable: test-vm1.py %(cores)s
        cores: [1]
    MyBin2:
        path: bin
        executable: test-vm2.py

# combining benchmark suites and executions
experiments:
    Example:
        suites:
          - ExampleSuite
        executions:
            - MyBin1
            - MyBin2
```

Saved as `test.conf`, this configuration could be executed with ReBench as follows:

```bash
rebench test.conf
```

See the documentation for details: [https://rebench.readthedocs.io/][docs].

## Support and Contributions

In case you encounter issues,
please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/smarr/rebench/issues/new)
so that we can help.

For contributions, we use pull requests. For larger contributions,
it is likely useful to discuss them upfront in an issue first.

### Development Setup

For the development setup, the currently recommended
way is to use `pip install --editable .` in the root directory of the repository.
You may also want to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python packages.

For instance:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smarr/rebench.git
cd rebench
pip install --editable .
```

Unit tests and linting can be run with:

```bash
python -m pytest
python -m pylint rebench
```

## Use in Academia

If you use ReBench for research and in academic publications, please consider
citing it.

The preferred citation is:

```bibtex
@misc{ReBench:2025,
  author = {Marr, Stefan},
  doi = {10.5281/zenodo.1311762},
  month = {February},
  note = {Version 1.3},
  publisher = {GitHub},
  title = {ReBench: Execute and Document Benchmarks Reproducibly},
  year = 2025
