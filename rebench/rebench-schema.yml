    invocations:
      type: int
      # default: 1  #  can't specify this here, because the defaults override settings
      desc: |
        The number of times an executor is executed a run.
    iterations:
      type: int
      # default: 1 #  can't specify this here, because the defaults override settings
      desc: |
        The number of times a run is executed within an executor
        invocation. This needs to be supported by a benchmark harness and
        ReBench passes this value on to the harness or benchmark.
    warmup:
      type: int
      desc: |
        Consider the first N iterations as warmup and ignore them in ReBench's summary
        statistics. Note ,they are still persisted in the data file.

    min_iteration_time:
      type: int
      # default: 50 #  can't specify this here, because the defaults override settings
      desc: |
        Give a warning if the average total run time of an iteration is below
        this value in milliseconds.
    max_invocation_time:
      type: int
      desc: |
        Time in second after which an invocation is terminated.
        The value -1 indicates that there is no timeout intended.
      # default: -1 #  can't specify this here, because the defaults override settings
    ignore_timeouts:
      type: bool
      desc: |
        When max_invocation_time is reached, do not report an error.
        Instead, accept the data and disregard the timeout.
        Benchmark setups that are confirmed to be working, for which errors
        or warnings may confuse users.
    parallel_interference_factor:
      type: float
      desc: |
        A higher factor means a lower degree of parallelism.
        TODO: should probably be removed
        TODO: then again, we might want this for research on the impact
    execute_exclusively:
      type: bool
      # default: true #  can't specify this here, because the defaults override settings
      desc: |
        TODO: probably needs to be removed, not sure. parallel exec of
        benchmarks introduced a lot of noise

    retries_after_failure:
      type: int
      # default: 0 #  can't specify this here, because the defaults override settings
      desc: |
        Some experiments may fail non-deterministically. For these, it may be
        convenient to simply retry them a few times.
        This value indicates how often execution should be retried on failure.

    input_sizes:
      type: seq
      desc: |
        Many benchmark harnesses and benchmarks take an input size as a
        configuration parameter. It might identify a data file, or some other
        way to adjust the amount of computation performed.

          desc: |
            A name used for this benchmark when sending data to Codespeed.
            This is useful to have a name different from the one relevant
            at the suite level.

schema;build_type:
  desc: |
    A list of commands/strings to be executed by the system's shell.
    They are intended to set up the system for benchmarking,
    typically to build binaries, compiled archieves, etc.
    Each command is executed once before any benchmark or executor that depend on it
    is executed. If the `location` or `path` of a suite/executor is set, it is used as
    working directory. Otherwise, it is the current working directory of ReBench.

    `build:` is a list of commands to allow multiple suites and executors to depend on the
    same build command without executing it multiple times.
    For this purpose, build commands are considered the same when they have the
    same command and location (based on simple string comparisons).
